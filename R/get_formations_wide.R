#' Get the K3 formations in widy format
#' @return a tibble with the K3 formations. Column names are:
#'
#' - `formation`: the formation number, where 1 is the first formation
#' - `member_1`: the first member of that formation
#' - `member_2`: the second member of that formation
#' - `member_3`: the third member of that formation
#'
#' The member names are sorted alphabetically
